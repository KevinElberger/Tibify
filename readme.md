# Tibify

A desktop application that keeps track of your friends on Tibia.

The MMORPG Tibia currently has no way of notifying you of events that occur in-game. Tibify makes it easy to keep track of your friends and enemies.

Tibify provides notifications for three events: when a user levels up, when a user dies, and when a user comes online.

## How to use

</p>

Simply add a friend's (or enemy's) username and check off which notifications you'd like to receive for that person!

Notifications will be displayed within 5-10 minutes of the event occurring.
